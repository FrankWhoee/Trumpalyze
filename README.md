# Trumpalyze
Takes an SRS of 100 Trump tweets and plots their tweet times in a histogram. I was just curious about when he tweeted most often.

To run:
- Clone the repository:
` git clone https://github.com/FrankWhoee/Trumpalyze.git`
or click the green button that says `Clone or download` and download as ZIP
- Extract the files
- Execute in terminal: `python3 collector.py`
